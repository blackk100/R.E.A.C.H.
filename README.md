# R.E.A.C.H.
Rocket for Experimental Agendas and Conquering Heights

An amateur rocketry attempt by a group of 3 Indian high school students from Hyderabad.

## Objectives of R.E.A.C.H.

1. Develop & test a cost effective solution for experimental testing of new concepts.
2. Set the Asian Amateur Rocketry Record for Altitude (Apoapsis).
3. Ultimately breach the Karman Line and go into Outer Space.

## Benefits of R.E.A.C.H.

1. **Concept Testing Framework:** The Project provides a framework to test new concepts safely at a very minimal cost.
2. **Scalability:** The Project is extremely scalable, with the base model capable of being upsacled into a a vehicle to launch payloads into orbit.
3. **Recoverability:** The Project aims to test a minimal system to recover the rocket along with all of its essential parts in working order, using a radically new recovery method.
4. **Versatility:** The Project is applicable in many scenarios, including but not limited to Earth.
5. **Cost Effectivity:** The Project is very cost effective at it's current stage. Hypothetically, The Concept can bring down costs of PSLV Launches by 40% (approx.) by making all parts except the 3rd stage recoverable in working condition, while not adding any new shielding for reentry or new major costs.

## Project Statistics

Given below are various statistics of the rocket:
1. **Dimensions:** 2m Cylinder with 0.1 Nose Cone of 0.05m Radius
2. **Wet Mass:** 4kg
3. **Estimated Apoapsis:** 100km
4. **Fuel:** Solid Bipropellant -> (Aluminium + HTBP (Hydroxyl-Terminated Polybutadiene)) + Ammonium Perchlorate
5. **Motor Dimensions:** Aluminium Pipe with 0.04m Radius with 5-star bore
