# R.E.A.C.H.
Rocket for Experimental Agendas and Conquering Heights

## Objectives of R.E.A.C.H.

1. Develop & Test a Cost Effective Solution for Experimental Testing of New Concepts
2. Mk0 aims To test a Novel Recovery Method
3. Set Amateur Asian Record for Altitude (Apoapsis) and Eurasian Record for Range of an Amateur Rocket
4. Breach the Kármán Line

## Benefits of R.E.A.C.H.

1. #### Concept Testing Framework: _The Project provides a framework to test new concepts safely at a very minimal cost._

2. #### Scalability: _The Project is extremely scalable, with the base model capable of being upsacled into a a vehicle to lauch payloads into orbit._

3. #### Recoverability: _The Project aims to test a minimal system to recover the rocket along with all of its essential parts in working order, using a radically new recovery method._

4. #### Versatility: _The Project is applicable in many scenarios, including but not limited to Earth._

5. #### Cost Effectivity: _The Project is very cost effective at it's current stage. Hypothetically, **The Concept can bring down costs of PSLV Launches by 40% (approx.) by making all parts except the 3<sup>rd</sup> stage recoverable in working condition,** while not adding any new shielding for reentry or new major costs._
