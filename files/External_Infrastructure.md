## Benefits of R.E.A.C.H.

1. #### Concept Testing Framework
   _The Project provides a framework to test new concepts safely, as it has a very minimal cost & simple operation. It can also viably test concepts as it can successfully reach altitudes to simulate the environment of space accurately._

2. #### Scalability
   _The Project is extremely scalable. The Mk 0 can be up scaled into a vehicle to launch payload upwards of 40Kg in stable Low Earth Orbit, with most of launch apparatus being recoverable. This up scaled model would be less than 10m tall with a similar radius with a slightly sophisticated multi-ignition motor & internal gimbal control._

3. #### Recoverability
   _The Project, with Mk 0, aims to test a minimal system to recover the rocket along with all of its essential parts in working order using a radically new recovery method. While it is not viable to recover everything under given budget constraints, this system of Hybrid Parachute-less Recovery is theoretically applicable to any spacecraft (or part thereof) with symmetry. The Recovery is exceptionally stable due to gyroscopic effects on the body & its internal axis of rotation._

4. #### Versatility
   _The Project is applicable in many scenarios, including but not limited to Earth. One of the objectives is to apply the Recovery concept to massive, conventionally non-recoverable parts of spacecrafts, which cannot use parachutes due to practical limits & cost barriers. The Concept can also be morphed into a landing strategy, finding applications for Martian Landings where use of prolonged retro bursts are usually required._

5. #### Cost Effectivity
   _The Project is very cost effective, with the Mk 0 costing less than 40,000INR. A fully recoverable prototype which can launch payloads into Low Earth Orbit is possible in under INR 4, 00,000. Hypothetically, The Concept can bring down costs of PSLV Launches by 40% (approx.) by making all parts except the 3rd stage recoverable in working condition, while not adding any new shielding for re-entry or new major costs._
