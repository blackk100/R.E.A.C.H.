4. Breach the Kármán Line

## Requirements of R.E.A.C.H. Mk 0

__We hope that the Indian Space Research Organization and/or the Defence Research & Development Organization provide us access/assistance to the following:__

## Benefits of R.E.A.C.H.

1. #### Concept Testing Framework

_The Project provides a framework to test new concepts safely, as it has a very minimal cost & simple operation. It can also viably test concepts as it can succesfully reach altitudes to simulate the environment of space accurately._

2. #### Scalability

_The Project is extremely scalable. The Mk 0 can be upscaled into a vehicle to launch payload upwards of 40Kg in stable Low Earth Orbit, with most of launch apparatus being recoverable. This upscaled model would be under 10m tall with a similar radius with a slightly sophisticated multi-ignition motor & internal gimbal control._

3. #### Recoverability

_The Project, with Mk 0, aims to test a minimal system to recover the rocket along with all of its essential parts in working order. While it is not viable to recover everything under given budget constraints, this system of Hybrid Parachuteless Recovery is applicable to any spacecraft (or part thereof) with symmetry. The Recovery is exceptionally stable due to gyroscopic effects on the body & its internal axis of rotation._

4. #### Versatility

_The Project is applicable in many scenarios, including but not limited to Earth. One of the objectives is to apply the Recovery concept to massive, conventionally non-recoverable parts of spacecrafts, which cannot use parachutes due to practical limits & cost barriers. The Concept can also be morphed into a landing strategy, finding applications for Martian Landings where use of prolonged retro bursts are usually required._

5. #### Cost Effectivity

_The Project is very cost effective, with the Mk 0 costing less than 40,000INR. A fully recoverable prototype which can launch payloads into Low Earth Orbit is possible in under INR 4,00,000. Hypothetically, **The Concept can bring down costs of PSLV Launches by 40% (approx.) by making all parts except the 3<sup>rd</sup> stage recoverable in working condition,** while not adding any new shielding for reentry or new major costs._
